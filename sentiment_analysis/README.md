# Sentiment Analysis Project

This project focuses on sentiment analysis of tweets using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict the sentiment of a tweet as either negative, neutral, or positive based on its text.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains tweets with the following columns:

- Target: The polarity of the tweet (0 = negative, 2 = neutral, 4 = positive)
- IDs: The ID of the tweet
- Date: The date of the tweet
- Flag: The query
- User: The user that tweeted
- Text: The text of the tweet

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/LLove01/kaggle.git

2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install pandas nltk scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn


3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `sentiment.ipynb` to see the code and analysis.

## Data Cleaning

The dataset undergoes several cleaning steps:

- Removal of unnecessary columns
- Removal of rows with missing values
- Text cleaning (lowercasing, special character removal, stopword removal, stemming)
- Mapping of target values to 0 (negative), 1 (neutral), and 2 (positive)

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The distribution of sentiments in the dataset can be visualized using a countplot. The countplot shows the number of tweets for each sentiment category.

## Feature Engineering

The text data is converted into a numerical representation using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). This conversion assigns higher weights to words that are more important for distinguishing between documents.

## Model Training and Evaluation

A logistic regression model is trained using the TF-IDF features. The model is evaluated using the classification report, which includes precision, recall, and F1-score for each sentiment category.

## Result Interpretation

The trained model achieves an accuracy of 78% in predicting the sentiment of a tweet. This suggests that it is reasonably possible to predict sentiment based on a tweet's text. However, the model's performance could potentially be improved by further tuning.

The distribution of sentiments in the dataset shows that positive sentiments are slightly more common than negative sentiments.

Certain words can serve as indicators of sentiment. In negative tweets, words like 'go', 'get', 'work', 'miss', and 'feel' are frequently used. In positive tweets, words like 'good', 'love', 'thank', and 'lol' are commonly found.

Please refer to the Jupyter Notebook `sentiment.ipynb` for detailed code and analysis.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for sentiment analysis of tweets. By analyzing the text of tweets, it is possible to predict the sentiment associated with them. Further improvements can be made by exploring different models and optimizing their parameters.
